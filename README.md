# NSSA 290-6 Homework 2

The program will run client(s) and server(s) for messaging based on TCP and UDP protocols

## To begin the server: 
Start the program by: double clicking or right click then run on the NSSAServer.jar file. 
Type in the type of connection you would like, either TCP or UDP. 
Then enter in a port number between 0 and 655355.
If configured correctly, a message will appear displaying information about the server.
The server is now up and listening for communication. 

## To begin the client: 
Start the program by: double clicking or right click then run on the NSSAClient.jar file. 
Type in the IP address of the machine the server is running on.
Type in the connection type the server is running, this will be either TCP or UDP.
Then type in the port number the server is running on, this will also be a number between 0 and 655355.
If configured correctly, a message will appear displaying information about the server.
The client program is running now as you will be able to send messages to the server and it will be 
echoed back and displayed on the client program. The program will remain running until you type "exit" to terminate connection and program.
